# Reflections 

Something I would do differently next time is to try to incorporate parallel computing into the project. Knitting each document took longer than I expected, so using parallel computing would have saved some time and computational power.   

I found it difficult to create effective visualizations with a response variable that was very heavily skewed. I would also look to improve this part of the project next time.    

This project taught me a lot about how to go about building different models and comparing them to determine which is the best for a given situation. Learning about this process and learning to consider a number of different models was my biggest takeaway from this project.
